This is my solution to the [3-column preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-).  

This is the first assignment given at the Engineering Career Expo 4.0 Front-end Development Track.


## This was built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


## Useful resources

- (https://easyretro.io/tools/hsl-to-hex/) - This helped me convert the color from hsl to hex for easy use in TailwindCSS.
